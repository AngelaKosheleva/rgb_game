    How to play: <br>
    After the game starts you will see a colored rectangle and several buttons with the name of the color in the RGB
    encoding. <br>
    You should choose the button with the correct color. If you clicked on the button with the right color, you get 10
    points, otherwise one point is taken. <br>
    The game has three difficulty levels - simple: three buttons and three attempts to guess the color, - average: six
    buttons and four attempts; and complex: nine buttons and only five attempts. If you failed to guess the color for
    all attempts, you will be shown the correct button and all the encrypted colors.<br>
